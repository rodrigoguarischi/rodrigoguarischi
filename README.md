I started in the field of bioinformatics in 2007, while pursuing a curriculum of academic excellence at University of São Paulo. 

During this time, I have had the opportunity to work mostly on: variant calling (genomics), bioinformatics pipeline development and automation, gene expression analysis by RNA-Seq (transcriptomics), prokaryotic genome assembly and annotation, angiogenesis and machine learning.

Currently, I work as the coordinator of bioinformatics at Diagnósticos da América (DASA), the largest group of clinical laboratories in LATAM and fourth largest in the world. I have a background in quantitative sciences and solid programming skills, with wide experience on NGS data processing. I am highly interested in biological questions that can be addressed by DNA sequencing, especially ideas that may be applied to improve general public health.
